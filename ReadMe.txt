The nodes of undirected graph is consists of integers or uppercase letters, when applying Prim's algorithm, the start vertex should be the leftmost node in ascending order.
(ex.nodes: A B C D ..., then "A" should be the start vertex)
INPUT:
The first line contains two integers: N,E, representing N nodes and E edges in the undirected graph.
The next lines contain three integers: a, b, and w, meaning an edge connects node a and node b, and the weight of the edge is equal to w.
OUTPUT:
The first line contains an integer, which is the sum of edge weights in the minimum spanning tree.
The next lines are the edges in MST, according to the weight in ascending order.
For each edge, containing three integers: a, b, and w, meaning an edge connects node a and node b in MST, and the weight of the edge is equal to w.
